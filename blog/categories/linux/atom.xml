        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had heard quite a lot about nix operating system.I had Mac OS X Mountain Lion installed on my desktop (Technically Hackintosh) , but just as I updated it , it ran into kernel panic mode.Due to busy schedule , I didn&rsquo;t bother repairing it and installed windows.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I moved to Linux.It was a bit frustrating a bit in early stages , but now I seem to have made a full transition.</p>

<p>There were lots of problems for a general user.First , there are so many packaging for different distro.There isn&rsquo;t a uniformity.Developers have to employ significant amountÂ of time , just to get there software working on Linux(Different Distros).Secondly , there are quite a few Linux users(Desktop) , that means the market is low for major software developers.Google Drive is still not available to Linux(Although Dropbox is , thank GOD!) ,GUI GIT isn&rsquo;t available(Who cares?) , but the list doesn&rsquo;t stop there.There are many softwares you won&rsquo;t find on windows.Remember how easy it was to install uTorrent client on windows , It is sick on linux.It runs inside a freaking browser!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To understand the solution , It would be better if we discuss about different types of partition and different UEFI first.</p>

<p>The most common partition type we have heard of is MBR.While I was trying to fix the bootloader , I realized mine had GPT partition.That meant I couldn&rsquo;t have loaded OS in UEFI mode as it was written is bootable USB for MBR system.</p>

<p>I downloaded a software and re-wrote Ubuntu , but this time for GPT with UEFI , and now the problem seems to have gone! ;) .</p>

<p>To write data ,or create partitions on the hard disks there it must have a Type of partition table.There are 2 types of them.The good old MBR(master boot record) and GPT(GUID partition table).</p>

<p>MBR was discovered way back in 1980s( I guess) , Well known for it&rsquo;s good compatibility with numerous operating systems , but limits the usage of the disk&rsquo;s size to 2 TB.</p>

<p>GUID works for bigger sizes , but requires compatible operating system and hardware.So , that was a n00b introduction to the partition tables.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>BIOS <del>is</del> the first thing that appears in older computers.</p>

<p>I recently purchased a new Laptop with UEFI . It felt awesome at first.The booting experience was quick and smooth.There was no flickering in the screen to indicate now the windows starts to load.Instead , the loading appears almost instantly as you press the power button.</p>

<p>I had purchased this laptop as it came with pre-installed windows.Never had I thought this would create wonderful problems for me.I am seriously addicted to Linux.But also wanted Genuine windows on the dual boot.But little did I knew about this stupid secure boot crap.</p>

<p>At first I created a 64-bit Ubuntu(14.04 LTS) .It refused to boot up at all.I disabled secure boot , no changes.I changed from UEFI to CMS , Ubuntu loaded up , but failed to recognize windows 8.1 on the other partition.I installed Ubuntu in another partition and it booted after the smooth installation.</p>

<p>Problems?</p>

<p>1)Brightness wouldn&rsquo;t change at all.It was 100% , and my eyes were under strain.But I looked in the support forum and solved the problem.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Open terminal</p></li>
<li><p>Type &ldquo;$ sudo gedit /etc/grub.d/10_linux</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the file</p></li>
<li><p>Replace where $4 is written by &ldquo;args="acpi_backlight=vendor $4&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>Save and exit gedit</p></li>
<li><p>type $ sudo update-grub &amp;&amp; sudo reboot</p></li>
</ul>


<p>2) Windows 8 doesn&rsquo;t show up in the GRUB menu.This is probably because it was preinstalled in UEFI mode.But then I tested it in windows Powershell command , it returned &ldquo;False&rdquo;.But why can&rsquo;t i boot Ubuntu in UEFI mode?</p>

<p>I also tried ubuntu&rsquo;s boot repair , but situation got worse.I got runtime error , and had to reinstall ubuntu to bring it to it&rsquo;s original state.</p>

<p>I am done with this now.No more experimenting on it.To boot to windows i&rsquo;ll set UEFI mode , for booting in Ubunto , CMS mode.</p>
